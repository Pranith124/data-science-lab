📊 Data Science Projects Practice
Welcome to the Data Science Projects Practice repository! This space is dedicated to building, testing, and refining data science skills through real-world projects and practical experimentation. Each project focuses on applying data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques to solve meaningful problems.

🚀 About
This repository serves as my personal learning lab for exploring various domains of data science including:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Data Visualization

Time Series Analysis

Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

Each project is developed with a focus on clean code, data storytelling, and reproducibility.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
Languages: Python, SQL

Libraries & Frameworks:

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

NLTK, SpaCy (for NLP projects)

TensorFlow, Keras or PyTorch (for deep learning)

Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

Git & GitHub for version control

Streamlit / Flask (for dashboard or model deployment, if applicable)

📚 Projects Included
Each folder contains a self-contained project with notebooks, data, and code.

📌 Student Performance Analysis

EDA on student grades dataset, identifying factors affecting academic outcomes.

📌 House Price Prediction

Regression model to predict housing prices using real estate data.

📌 Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
